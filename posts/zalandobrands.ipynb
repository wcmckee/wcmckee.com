Karl Kani himself is a shining example of a man who's lived the American Dream - a self-taught designer and a self-made man, Karl Kani spent his youth exploring his passion for music and fashion, until at 16 years old he started to design his own clothing. Pretty soon everyone was after something created by this hip young designer, and the rest, as they say, is history. Today the brand is internationally renowned for bringing fresh fashion to guys with attitude, its clothing has been seen on Hollywood film stars and rap legends, and P.

The brand started off as a company manufacturing Jute fibre, which it now uses to make the espadrilles that Vidorreta now specialises in. after many years acquiring knowledge in this material and having consolidated the market, Vidorreta focused on the design and production of its own espadrille collections. The brand can look back on a long tradition and expertise in manufacturing espadrilles and now interprets these into a new and fresh modern look. Instead of the original flat espadrille, Vidorreta focuses less on this classic version but more on trendy shapes, colours and heel heights with a completely new look.
