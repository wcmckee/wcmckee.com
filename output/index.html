<p>What made you choose that particular Creative Commons licence?</p>
<p>I like the CC:BY licence because it offers the most freedom to people.</p>
<p>I am not a fan of licenses that restrict commercial use. I believe everyone should be able to do what the like with my work with minimal interference.</p>
<p>If I could I would remove non-commercial licenses.</p>
<p>In the early days of my art blogging I would license under cc nc. This was wrong and I later changed this to a cc by licence.</p>
<p>With my photography I once had a photo I taken in the newpaper. It made the front page. I was offered money and seeked permission. I was fine with it of course - the license allows this. At the bottom of the photo it read: PHOTO: William Mckee.
Perfect.</p>
<p>The only thing I ask is they attribute.</p>
<p>I like the idea of sharealike but at the end of the I really don't care and would hate to chase down people to license it wrong. Sure, I don't like it that people could take my stuff and make it not open. I think everything should be open and free.</p>
<p>My art site - artcontrol.me is currently down but when it was up I licenced the site under a cc:by. Elements of the site are still up - such as my YouTube channel.</p>
<p>I attended art school in Wellington - The Learning Connexion. My focus was on drawing and painting. I taught myself programming on the bus to art school. Even when I was drawing on the easel I would be 'drawing' python code. During breaks I would often get my laptop out.</p>
<p>I volunteered at Whaihanga Early Learning Centre. I spend the majority of my time there in the art area doing collabarth works with others. Oil Pastel, coloured pencil and pencil were my mediums of choice. Sometimes I would use paint, but it's quite messy.</p>
<p>Copyright shouldn't be default. Apply and pay if you want copyright. CC license by default. That will sort the world.</p>
